# 💻 Laptop Price Predictor

This project predicts the **price of laptops** based on their specifications such as RAM, Processor, GPU, Operating System, and more.  
It uses **machine learning models** implemented in Python to analyze the dataset and build a prediction system.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **`laptop.csv`**, which contains specifications and price details of laptops.  
Some of the key features include:
- Brand
- Processor
- RAM
- Storage
- GPU
- Operating System
- Display
- Price (Target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy (Data preprocessing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook (Development environment)

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare accuracy and performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)

---

## 📈 Results
- The project compares different machine learning models.
- Provides insights into which features impact laptop prices the most.
